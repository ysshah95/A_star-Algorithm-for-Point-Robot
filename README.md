# A_star-Algorithm-for-Point-Robot
Implementation of A* Algorithm on a point robot to find the optimal path in an environment with obstacles. 

Running The Program:
1) Code for this Program is stored in [main.m] file. 
2) Change the working directory to that folder in MATLAB and open [main.m] file.
3) Run the program.
4) Select the starting point and end Goal Point on the Graph. 
5) Wait till it calculates the optimum path. 
6) The optimum path will be showed in blue dots. 

Example Results:
1) Open [Result] folder.
2) It contains some videos and pictures that shows how nodes explands using A* Algorithm.
